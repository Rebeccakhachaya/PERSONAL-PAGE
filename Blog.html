             They went and signed papers and that was it .One year or so later Andrew was born and they went to meet Abel's family in Tsonga homeland .
             Women in Tsonga do all the domestic tacks and bow when they meet men Patricia mocks these customs by going over the top which makes everyone uncomfortable .Patricia is independent and she is not afraid to point out how<br>
              ridiculous she finds it that Abel's family effectively treats women as servants . 
              There instance where even  Trevor a nine year child is not allowed to do any house chores simply because he is a boy child this made Patricia loathed every moment she was there .He is forced to go out <br>

            He is violence he attacks Patricia and hit her when they got into an argument ,Abel desires for control over the family and uses violence to control Patricia's actions who refuses to live by others rules and so she has no interest in giving him chance.patricia  says that Abel is like an exotic bird collector this means that Abel is chauvinst person and only want to control Patricia . </p>
        
            <h1>Humor in Born a crime by Trevor Noah</h1>
            <p>
            Humor is the state of being in a good mood .In born a crime  Trevor Noah has use humor in different instances to make friends and get out of difficult situations .<br>
             Trevor says that he had a Tom and Jerry relationship with her mother since he was a naughty boy. He says that he had being the  using change from buying bread and milk to play videogames and he was a master of street fighter and next thing he knew was a  woman with a belt his mother ready to race .He had to take off the door and through 
             the dusty streets of Eden park and his mother would be right behind him runing in her weird move her ankles and heels would go flying  and if he was about to get  away she would yell,"stop! theif! " which is a humor since she was doing that to her own son.<br>
              Another example of humor is when Trevor and his mother were coming from the church and they were waiting for the  minibus for along time until  Trevor was about to sleep on his feet .They started walking but eventually a car drove and stopped and the driver offered them them a ride before even they drove far a minibus swerved right in front of the car and cut them off .The driver of the minibus was accussing the car driver "why are you stealing our customers ? " good enogh Trevor's mother spoke  up defending the driver that he was just helping them and he should leave him alone.So they got out of the car and climbed the minibus.
            but when they drove along the driver started lecturing Trevor's mom.The driver was from Zulu tribal enemy of Xhosa the Patricia tribe
            He speed off and was not willing to stop.Trevor mother whispered to Trevor "when he slows down at the next intersection I'm going to open the door and we're going to jump ."<br> 
            The funny thing is that Trevor did not hear any thing untill he smacked hard on the pavement he thought that he was dreaming he went from half asleep to what the hell.So he started running but Trevor did not know why  they were running until they made it to the petrol station.<br>
            Tim was Trevor's friend  who used to sell the CDs that Trevor copied in exachange for a cut.He was a chatterbox hyperactive .So one day Tim told Trevor that they were going to see a talent show which was in little community hall attached to nothing in the middle of nowhere .when they got there Tim was going around shaking hands and chatting with everybody.Then the host got up onstage and said they have a special performer rapper all the way from America Trevor was confused 
            then everyone in the room turned and looked at him.Tim walked and whispered in his ear telling hi to go up onstage."Dude ,please ,you are going to get me in so much shit. They've all ready paid me the money."Tim had failed to tell Trevor that he had told the people that he was bringing a famous rapper from America to come rap in their talent show Trevor got up onstage and Tim did some terrible beat-boxing while he was stumbled through some rhymes lyrics that he made the audience erupted with cheers and applause .It was the most epic thing Trevor had ever seen.<br>
             He did not know any of the lyrics.<br>
